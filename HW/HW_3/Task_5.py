    The program asks the user for a string of numbers separated by a space.
    When you press Enter, the sum of the numbers should be displayed.
    The user can continue to enter numbers separated by a space and press Enter again.
    The sum of the newly entered numbers will be added to the already calculated
    amount. But if a special character (Stop or stop) is entered instead of a number, the program
    ends. If a special character is entered after several numbers, then first you
    need to add the sum of these numbers to the previously received amount and then
    complete the program.
