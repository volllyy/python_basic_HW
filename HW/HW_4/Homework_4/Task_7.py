"""
Implement the generator using a function with the yield keyword
that creates the next value. When a function is called, a generator
object must be created. The function should be called as follows:
for el in fib_gen (). The function is responsible for obtaining
the factorial of the number, and in the loop it is necessary to display
only the first 15 numbers.
