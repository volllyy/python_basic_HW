# HW5 - Task â„– 7
# Create (not programmatically) a text file in which each
# line should contain information about the company: name,
# form of ownership, revenue, costs.

# It is necessary to read the file line by line, calculate
# the profit of each company, as well as the average profit.
# If the company received losses, do not include it in the
# calculation of average profit.

# Next, implement the list. It should contain a dictionary
# with firms and their profits, as well as a dictionary with
# average profit. If the company received losses, also add it
# to the dictionary (with the value of losses).

# Save the resulting list as a json object to the corresponding file.
