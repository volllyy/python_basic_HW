# HW6 - Task â„– 1
Create a TrafficLight class (traffic light) and define one color
attribute and a running method. The attribute is implemented as private.
As part of the method, implement switching traffic lights in modes: red,
yellow, green. The duration of the first state (red) is 7 seconds, the second
(yellow) - 2 seconds, the third (green) - at your discretion. Switching between
modes should be carried out only in the indicated order (red, yellow, green).
Test the example by creating an instance and calling the described method.
