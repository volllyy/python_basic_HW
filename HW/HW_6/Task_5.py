# HW6 - Task â„– 5
Implement the base class Car. This class should have the following
attributes: speed, color, name, is_police (boolean). As well as
methods: go, stop, turn (direction), which should report that the
car went, stopped, turned (where). Describe several child classes:
TownCar, SportCar, WorkCar, PoliceCar. Add the show_speed method to
the base class, which should show the current speed of the car. For
the TownCar and WorkCar classes, override the show_speed method. At
speeds above 60 (TownCar) and 40 (WorkCar), a speeding message should
be displayed.
